## **Live It, The Open Gate Manifesto: A Charter for Inclusive Innovation and Economic Democracy**

\
**OPEN MARKETS, NO BARRIERS** At Premia, we don't just advocate for open markets; we embody them. Championing the democratization of financial access is our core mission, and we relentlessly pursue it. All opportunities, whether internal collaborations or external engagements, are accessible by default. There are no hidden agendas, no insurmountable walls. We fear no challenge in being transparent and honest with ourselves, our contributors, and our community, we **live it** every day. In a world where barriers often define the landscape, we are the pathfinders, breaking down walls and building bridges to financial empowerment.

**BUILD WITH VISION AND EQUITY** Every day at Premia, we strive to create products that are not just innovative but revolutionary. Building with vision means more than crafting solutions; it's about shaping the future. It's about believing in what we're doing so passionately that it becomes a mission, not just a task. We use it, we own it, we **live it**. When we build with equity, we're not just considering the bottom line; we're looking at the bigger picture. We consider how our initiatives and decisions affect our community, participants, and the world. Equity is not an afterthought; it's the foundation of our innovation. Led by the belief that everyone deserves a fair shot at financial success, and we're here to make it happen.

**DON'T BETRAY THE COMMUNITY** Trust is the cornerstone of Premia's relationship with the community. When we make internal decisions, we don't just consider the business implications; we ask ourselves, "How will this affect our community?" If the answer is that it would undermine them or make access more complex, we don't just find another way; we find a better way. A more inclusive way. A way that honors the trust that the community has placed in us. We recognize that trust is not given; it's earned. And we commit to earning it at every dawn, with every decision, and through every action, we **live it**. Our community is not just an audience; they are our partners, collaborators, and inspiration. Betraying them is not an option; empowering them is our promise.

**INNOVATE AS A COLLECTIVE** In the world of Premia, innovation is not a solitary pursuit but a collective endeavor. We want all Premiansâ€”contributors, participants, and visionariesâ€”to feel like they are integral parts of the Premia movement, not mere cogs in a machine.

Innovating with your collaborators means embracing diverse perspectives, fostering a culture of creativity, and recognizing that the best ideas often emerge from the synergy of minds. It's about working together, not just alongside each other, to create something greater than the sum of its parts.

Contributing to the Premia collective is more than just a task; it's a calling. It's about believing in democratizing financial access and taking active steps to make it a reality. It's about being part of a community that values openness, equity, and the power of collaboration.

At Premia, we don't just talk about innovation; we **live it**. We encourage every Premian to bring their unique insights, passions, and talents. Together, we are not just building products; we are shaping the future of finance, redefining what's possible, and creating a legacy of positive change.

**EMBRACE THE META-ECONOMY YOU SEEK** The call to redefine economics is not just a distant echo; it's a clarion call that resonates at the core of Premia. It's a path we must walk ourselves, not just preach to others. At Premia, we don't just encourage everyone to create positive change; we live it, breathe it, and embody it.

We're not content with the status quo; we're constantly looking for ways to improve our platform, products, and impact. Innovation is not a one-time achievement; it's an ongoing journey. A journey towards a meta-economy where financial access is not a privilege but a right. Where opportunities are not hoarded but shared. Where success is not exclusive but inclusive.

In a world of closed doors, where barriers often define the boundaries of possibility, we are the open gate. We are the way forward. We are the promise of a new era where economics is not just about numbers and figures but about people, dreams, and empowerment.

Embracing the meta-economy is not just about changing systems; it's about changing lives. It's about building a world where financial freedom is not a distant dream but a tangible reality. It's about creating a space where everyone has a seat at the table, where voices are heard, and where dreams are nurtured.

At Premia, we don't just seek the meta-economy; we are building it. Brick by brick, idea by idea, collaboration by collaboration. And we invite you to join us in this remarkable journey. Because the future is not something we wait for; it's something we create.

**Live it.**



## **A Meta-Economic Manifesto**

**ALWAYS EMBRACE OPENNESS.** You should be pushing boundaries and embracing openness, especially in finance. Big changes. Trying what may not have been tried before. Asking questions that challenge the status quo. Seeing if the doors you open remain unshut.

**BE REVOLUTIONARY.** Some will push traditional economics on you. Others will make you pull what you need from the new era. Challenge both. Question their assumptions. Ask for innovation.

**BREAK THE BARRIERS.** Defying the barriers forces you to stray from the path of conventional finance and ultimately create a platform that is more inclusive, more empowering, and more revolutionary.

**EXPLORE EVERY POSSIBILITY. DISMISS NOTHING.** Every idea has the potential to be groundbreaking and transformative. Not every idea will be, but the more you explore, the better your chances of finding something that will redefine finance.

**BE PASSIONATE.** Passion drives you to explore and discover as much as possible about something that inspires you. In the world of Premia, passion fuels innovation.

**BE UNCONVENTIONAL.** It's easy to follow the beaten path of traditional finance. Truly great, inspiring, and transformative platforms come not from convention but from unconvention.

**BE VISIONARY.** You should have visions about finance and the world around you. Preferably, you should have bold visions. Ideally, you should have bold and informed visions.

**BE A PIONEER.** A Premian is a modern pioneer. When you are part of Premia, you are part of a movement 24/7/365. Constantly innovating, always observing, continuously redefining, even if only of the mind.
