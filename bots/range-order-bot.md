# Range Order Bot

The range order bot is a market making script that allows users to quote two-sided markets (using concentrated liquidity) for whatever option markets that are preDefined within the settings. IV & Spot oracles are used to automatically update range orders as option prices change, minimizing the need for active management of orders. It is highly recommended that a user is familiar with how range orders work, and the risks associated with owning option positions.
