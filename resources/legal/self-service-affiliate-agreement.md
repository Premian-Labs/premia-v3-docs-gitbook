**Self-Service Affiliate Agreement**

**Referral Terms and Conditions** • **Last updated:** February 6, 2023

This Self-Service Affiliate Agreement f/k/a Self-Service Affiliate Addendum (this “Agreement”), as revised or modified from time to time in accordance with Section 15.2, is a legally binding agreement between Premia, a blockchain protocol provider ("Premia"), and you (“Affiliate" and together with Premia, the “Parties"). This Agreement incorporates and supplements Premia’s Terms of Use (the “Terms”), and Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”), in each case, to which Affiliate agrees that Affiliate is bound and is a party, and the terms of which apply to this Agreement. Please review the Terms carefully to understand Affiliate’s rights and obligations, including with respect to governing law, arbitration, venue for dispute resolution and other dispute resolution matters, prohibited activities, indemnification, disclosures and disclaimers, limitations of liability, and exclusions of consequential damages and other claims.

Participating in Premia’s self-service affiliate program (the "Affiliate Program”) indicates Affiliate’s acceptance of this Agreement, as well as the Terms and the Privacy Policy, and establishes a binding and executed written agreement between Affiliate and Premia. If Affiliate does not accept this Agreement or the Terms, Affiliate may not participate in the Affiliate Program.

**1. Referrals.**

**1.1** "Qualified Referrals” mean individuals or entities who complete trades on the Premia protocol (each “Users”) and who:

* (a) click on Affiliate's unique affiliate link (the “Link”);
* (b) if entering into perpetual contracts on the Premia protocol (the “Protocol”), then do not reside, are not citizens of, are not located in, and do not have a registered office in the United States of America ("US Person”) or any Restricted Territory (as defined in the Terms); and
* (c) complete at least one trade using the Protocol after clicking on the Link.

Affiliate acknowledges and agrees that Affiliate has no ownership rights in any form over the Link Premia provides to Affiliate, and Premia may reclaim, deactivate, invalidate or terminate the Link at any time in its sole discretion.

**1.2** If Affiliate shares the same personal information, including email address, IP address, or website details, as an otherwise Qualified Referral, then Affiliate will be deemed to have made a "Self-Referral.” No Affiliate Reward (as defined below) will be paid for any Self-Referral. Premia, in its sole discretion, will determine the classification of any referral as a Self-Referral.

**2. Affiliate Rewards.**

**2.1** Each epoch, set forth in [https://docs.premia.finance/premia-governance/start-here/epochs](https://docs.premia.finance/premia-governance/start-here/epochs) (“Epoch”), Affiliate will receive certain percentages set forth in Exhibit A of the net trading fees that Premia receives from a Qualified Referral, taking into account for purposes of the net trading fees determination any discounts, rebates and refunds Premia provides to a Qualified Referral or other parties, including market makers, such that the amount of such discounts, rebates or refunds will not be part of the net trading fees used to determine the affiliate reward, in accordance with the following (the “Affiliate Reward”):

* **2.1.1** calculated from time to time during each Epoch (each a "Calculation Time”) and accrued based on any additional net trading fees that Premia has received from a Qualified Referral after the prior Calculation Time, and
* **2.1.2** based on the amount of the Ethereum-based token known as stkPremia set forth across from such percentage in Exhibit A held at the Ethereum network address linked to Affiliate’s Premia account at the time of each Calculation Time; provided that (a) prior to receiving any material Affiliate Reward, Affiliate may be required to provide Premia with any additional information Premia determines is necessary to comply with applicable laws, (b) prior to receiving any Affiliate Reward greater than or equal to six hundred (600) USD Coin (USDC), Affiliate must complete any required tax or other forms relating to receipt of Affiliate Rewards, as required by Premia in its sole discretion, and (c) payment of any such Affiliate Reward is subject to compliance with applicable laws and the terms and conditions of the Protocol.

**2.2** Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of calculating the net trading fees received by Premia from a Qualified Referral during each Epoch to which the applicable percentage in Exhibit A is applied, the maximum net trading fees will be seventy five thousand (75,000) USD Coin (USDC), such that the maximum net trading fees on which such percentage will be applied each Epoch for each Qualified Referral is seventy five thousand (75,000) USD Coin (USDC), meaning that the Affiliate Reward each Epoch for each Qualified Referral can never exceed thirty thousand (30,000) USD Coin (USDC) (i.e., 40% \* 75,000).

**2.3** The amount of Affiliate Rewards will be based upon Premia’s good faith calculation and information available to Premia. Premia is not responsible for any Affiliate Rewards not properly being paid to Affiliate of which Premia is unaware, including due to computer error or other reasons.

**2.4** Affiliate Rewards will be payable to Affiliate within thirty (30) days of the end of the Epoch in which Premia receives associated trading fees from Qualified Referrals. Affiliate Rewards will be paid to Affiliate in USD Coin (USDC) to Affiliate’s Premia account on the Premia protocol.

**2.5** Affiliate is responsible for any and all tax liabilities, including income tax liabilities, that arise from or in any way relate to any payments Premia makes to Affiliate, including income taxes, sales, personal property, use, VAT, excise, withholding, Social Security and Medicare taxes, and self-employment taxes. Premia will have the right to withhold from any amounts payable to Affiliate such federal, state, local or foreign taxes as may be required to be withheld under any applicable law or regulation.
