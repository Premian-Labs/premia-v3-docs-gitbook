2\. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

“Personal Information”, also often referred to as “Personal Data”, means information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, household, or device, such as the individual’s first and last name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, username, and/or image. The categories of personal information we collect depend on how you use the Services and the requirements of applicable law.

&#x20;

_Information You Provide to Us_

• Wallet Address: In order for us to provide you with the Services, we will require to know and process your Wallet Address. Whilst in most instances, your Wallet Address will not be able to identify you as an individual (and therefore, it will not be considered personal information as the law strictly defines it), in certain limited circumstances, it could lead to you being identifiable, for example, if it was stored alongside another identifier. To reduce the chances of you being identifiable from your Wallet Address, we do not process it with or store it alongside any other identifiers listed below, such as your direct IP address.

• Location Data: In accordance with our Terms of Service, we do not offer or provide our Services in Restricted Countries, or permit persons or entities located in Restricted Countries to use our Services (please see Terms of Service for more information). To confirm you are not located in a Restricted Country, we collect your IP address and country code when connecting to or accessing our Services. To ensure compliance with our Terms of Services, we store the IP address and country code of any person who tries to access our Services from a Restricted Country. If you are accessing from a country which is not a Restricted Country, we will immediately delete your IP address and country code after confirming your location. Please note that location checking occurs each time you access the Services.

• Restricted Company Mailing List: In accordance with the above, if we identify from your IP address and country code that you are located in a Restricted Country, we provide you the opportunity to be added to a mailing list which will ensure you are notified if the Restricted Country list is updated. To do this, we require your email address. Unless you specify otherwise, we will not use your email address for other marketing purposes.

• Transaction Information: When you commence using our Services, the Ethereum blockchain and other public blockchains provide transparency into transactions. As this information is linked to your Wallet Address, it will almost never identify you as an individual but it will provide us a clear insight into your transactions which is required to perform the Services.

From this, we may collect further preferences from you based on how you interact and respond to our marketing communications. You have the right at any time to withdraw your consent at any time.

In some jurisdictions, we are required to publicly share information of winners.
