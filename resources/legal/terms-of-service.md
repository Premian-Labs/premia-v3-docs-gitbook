# Terms of Service

## Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** March 2023



Please read these Terms of Service carefully as they form a legally binding contract between you and us.

These terms of service (the “Terms”) govern your (“you” or “your”) use of the services provided by Premia, including https://premia.blue/ (the “Website”) and any of its other platforms, websites or apps, and your Account (as defined below) (collectively, the “Services”), and creates a binding contract between you and the operator of the Premia Ecosystem of smart contracts (“Premia,” "we," "us," or "our"). Defy Network Services Limited (“Defy”) manages the Website, which acts as a front-end to the decentralized Premia Ecosystem. For the avoidance of doubt, Defy is not the operator of the Premia Ecosystem of smart contracts and has no control to update, enhance, amend, fix, or otherwise alter any of the smart contracts that may be interacted with on the Website or through the Services.

Any reference to “Account” in these Terms shall mean the wallet account you self-custody that interacts with us to allow you to use the Services. “Account” may also be used with respect to other Service users who have opened an account with us.

We ask you to please read these Terms thoroughly so you properly understand your obligations and your rights in relation to our Services and your Account. By installing, accessing, downloading, or otherwise using the Services, you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by these Terms. If you breach or violate any of the Terms, we have the right to disable and block your access to the Services immediately.

We can make updates to these Terms at any time and will make any updated versions of the Terms available via the Services. Your continued use of the Services will be deemed acceptance of the updated Terms. However, if you do not accept the updated Terms, you can no longer use the Services. We therefore encourage you to regularly review the Terms to ensure you are fully aware of your obligations and rights regarding the Services.

17\. Electronic Signature and Wallet Signatures for Premia Protocol

By engaging with the Premia Protocol and utilizing its electronic services, you provide your explicit consent and agreement to the use of electronic signatures. This consent extends to the act of selecting items, buttons, icons (including electronic "I accept" buttons), or any analogous actions using devices such as keypads, mice, or other devices. Through these actions, you signify your acceptance, agreement, and signature, akin to a physical signature on a written document.

This agreement encompasses a wide array of activities, including accessing electronic services, making transactions, and engaging with documents, agreements, acknowledgments, consents, terms, disclosures, and conditions presented through our electronic platform. While utilizing these services, your actions hold the same legal weight as if you had physically signed the documents in writing.

Your interaction with documents, agreements, terms, or disclosures that you have accepted or agreed to and your historical transactions is available on the Premia Platform. Additionally, these records are included in the notices and communications we may send you.

As the Premia Protocol advances, it is crucial to acknowledge the role of wallet signatures, specifically Eth\_sign requests. Utilizing your wallet signature in processes such as electronic agreements and transactions further solidifies your acceptance and agreement, enhancing security and authenticity in your digital interactions.

We encourage you to confidently engage with the Premia Protocol's electronic services, knowing that your actions are considered legally binding and secure and that your electronic signature holds the same significance as a traditional handwritten signature.
