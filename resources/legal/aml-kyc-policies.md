## Compliance and Risk Management: Screening High-Risk Wallets

Premia employs [Elliptic's Holistic Screening](https://www.elliptic.co/solutions/holistic) for compliance and risk management. This technology enables efficient, automated screening of customer activity across multiple blockchains. It identifies high-risk wallets, which are subsequently excluded from the Premia platform. The screening is powered by Elliptic's Nexus engine, capable of tracing crypto-asset flows across all assets and blockchains. This ensures Premia's alignment with global financial crime regulations.
